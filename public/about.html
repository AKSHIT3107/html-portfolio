<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Akshit, a Computer Engineering undergraduate at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology 
  with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a growing passion for AI and machine learning.</p>

  <p>My journey in tech started with a curiosity to build things that matter this led me to develop projects
  like a full-featured blog platform and a large-scale F1 Car Racing Management System, both built with modern 
  web stacks such as ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB. These experiences have helped me understand how to architect
   scalable solutions and deliver engaging user experiences.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I've honed my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills through active roles in student-led initiatives. As a Marketing Executive for the Paryavaran Welfare Society and a Volunteer Educator with Pratigya Abhiyan, I've learned to connect, engage, and lead with purpose whether through campus campaigns or mentoring over 200 students in community programs.

  Professionally, I've explored the realms of machine learning and data science during my internship at InternsElite, where I contributed to developing ML models, working with NLP and computer vision, and diving into data to uncover insights that inform smart solutions.</p>

<p>From topping my school academically to winning basketball tournaments, I believe in being equally committed to intellectual and personal growth. I'm always eager to learn, build, and be part of projects that push boundaries and create real-world impact.

  <p>Let's connect and build something awesome together!.</p>
